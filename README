Final project for CS 2261 (Media Device Architecture) for the GameBoy Advance. Inspired by the Kung-Fu for the NES, you play as Professor Bill Leahy as he 'teaches' his students the ancient ways.

Move with the arrow keys, jump with the up arrow, kick with Z (the A button on the GBA). Can be played by opening cs1372.gba with Visual Boy Advance (http://vba.ngemu.com/).
